session.get(EntityType,id);
session.load(EntityType,id);

get()
-->get method of hibernate returns null if object is not found in database as well as in cache
-->load method throws ObjectNotFoundException if object not found in cache as well as in db but never returns null.

-->get::Use if you are not sure that object exist in db or not.
load::Use if you sure that object exists

-->get::get() involves db call if value does not exist in cache and may invoke many db calls.
load::Return proxy in place and only initialize the object or hit the db if any method other than getId() is called on persistent
or entity object.This lazy initialization increases the performance.
